There are 3 main components to this server setup:
1) PHP-based API - new-facade.php and (coming soon) nearby-facades.php. Accept
    HTTP requests and return json.
2) Database and file storage - MySQL database stores metadata about facades.
    Copies of uploaded facade images are stored in uploads/. Fern files in 
    ferns/. These are defaults and can be changed with settings.php.
3) Deferred processing daemon - A PHP-based daemon (using System::Daemon) that
    continually scans the database for unprocessed files and sends them to the
    ferns processor (located in exec/) which is written in C++ and uses OpenCV.

Dependencies:
- PEAR and System::Daemon: http://pear.php.net/package/System_Daemon
- AllowOverride All set in Apache config files (to block access to exec/) via
  a .htaccess file.
- PHP 5.2.0 or greater for built in json support.
